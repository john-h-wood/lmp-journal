	\section{Numbers and Notation}
	We begin by trying to justify a distiction between numbers and their notation. If you are asked to write a random number, you might write ``10.'' That peice of writing is not, itself, the number you are thinking of. Rather, the symbols you write \textit{refer} to a certain number. To see this, consider that the same number could be written differently. Using Roman numerals, the symobl ``X'' refers to the same number as ``10.'' Alternatively, notice that different languages use unique speech to speak of the same number. We don't say that an enligh-speaker's ``ten'' and a french-speaker's ``dix'' are different numbers. Instead, we know that English and French have different methods of referring to the same number.
	
	So, there is a difference between a number and how it is written and said. When a number is written or spoken, there is a reference to the number. A system for writting representations of something is sometimes called a ``notation.''
	
	We can think of the reference-based relationship between notations and numbers with functions. For example, consider the set of symbols $\mathbb{S}$ of some notation which represents real numbers. For this notation to be useful, there must be some function $f:\mathbb{S}\rightarrow\R$ which gives the number refered to for each symbol.
	
	Here, we invesitgate positional notation.
	
	\subsection{Notation Requirement}
	In our case, it is impossible to consider numbers without notation systems. As I write equations here, I must use some writing to insert numbers into your mind. When I write ``0,'' you read that as zero and then the number appears in your mind. There is no other way to do this in writing other than to use a system which you and I both understand. I commonly use what is called the decimal system.
	
	Here, I intend to dicsuss symbols such as ``0'' separately from the numbers they bring up in your mind; the numbers they reference. But then, how should I bring up the actual number referenced by ``0?'' To do so, let us define a new notation for numbers. This will be the same system as we have always used, but with bars on top of the symbols. For example, the symbols $\overline{34}$ refer to the same number as $34$. I will carefully use this system for when a symbol should refer to a number. Thus, when writing ``45,'' I am not trying to refer to any number, but am just writing certain symbols.
